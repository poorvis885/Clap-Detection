🌟 PureCheck: Milk Adulteration Detection System 🥛🔬

🚀 Overview
PureCheck is a compact IoT-enabled system designed to detect milk adulteration in real time. By leveraging pH, TDS, and turbidity sensors, this system ensures safe and pure milk for consumption. The results are displayed in a color-coded format, making them easy to interpret.

🔧 Tech Stack
Hardware: Arduino Nano, pH Sensor, TDS Sensor, Turbidity Sensor
Software: Python, Arduino IDE
Libraries: Matplotlib, Pandas, Serial Communication (pyserial)

✨ Features
✅ Real-time detection of contaminants in milk
✅ Compact & portable design for easy use
✅ User-friendly visualization with color-coded feedback
✅ Efficient & cost-effective IoT-based solution
