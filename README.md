# Clap-Detection

**Description:**  
The **Clap Detection** project is a simple and interactive system designed to detect loud sound events, such as claps, using a sound sensor. The system can trigger a response such as turning on an LED or any other feedback mechanism when a clap is detected. This project can be implemented using an **Arduino** or a **Raspberry Pi**. It is a great starting point for beginners to learn about sensor interfacing and sound detection.

**Tech Stack:**  
- **Hardware:**
  - Arduino or Raspberry Pi  
  - Sound Sensor (Microphone)
  - LED (for feedback)
- **Software:**
  - **Arduino IDE** (for Arduino-based implementation)
  - **Python** (for Raspberry Pi-based implementation)
  - **Libraries**: `sounddevice` and `numpy` (for Raspberry Pi Python implementation)



### Features:
- Detects loud sounds, such as claps.
- Triggers a response (e.g., turning on an LED).
- Simple project for beginners to understand sound sensors and microcontroller interfacing.
- Can be extended for use in voice-activated systems or other interactive applications.
